        <h2>Birdbox Overview</h2>
        <p>The last movie I watched that was my favourite was Birdbox. I am a fan of thriller/horror movies and Birdbox was a good match for both of these genres.
            It is a captivating story about a mother and her two children as they go on an adventure to reach a safe haven while there is a deadly virus going around.
            They have blindfolds on and must do everything without sight. It is called Birdbox because the "virus" is scared of the loud chirps birds make. 
            The movie jumps between the main character, Malorie's, past experiences and current state.</p>
